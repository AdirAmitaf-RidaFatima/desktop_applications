# üñ•Ô∏è Python GUI Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my Python GUI Projects repository!
This space serves as a growing collection of beginner to intermediate-level graphical user interface (GUI) projects built using Python, mainly with Tkinter (and possibly other libraries in the future like PyQt or Kivy). The goal is to build, learn, and demonstrate key concepts in GUI application development.

## Project Structure
Each folder in this repository represents a standalone project, with its own code and explanation.
The projects are beginner-friendly and ideal for those learning Python and GUI development.

## What's Inside
### 1. First GUI Window
**File:** `01_first_window.py`
**Description:** This is the most basic Tkinter GUI ‚Äî a single window displaying a title.<br>
Concepts Covered: Initializing Tkinter, Creating a root window, Main event loop<br>

### 2. Miles to Kilometers Converter Basic
**File:** `02_miles_to_km_converter_basic.py`  
**Description:** A simple GUI that takes user input in miles and converts it to kilometers using the conversion rate (1 mile = 1.60934 km).<br>  
**Concepts Covered:** Tkinter layout using `pack()` and frames, variable binding with `IntVar` and `StringVar`, widget nesting, event-driven function execution.<br>

### 3. Miles to Kilometers Converter (Styled with ttkbootstrap)
**File:**: `03_miles_to_km_converter_prettier_version`
**Description:** An enhanced version of the miles to kilometers converter with a clean and modern look using ttkbootstrap themes. Minimal code changes from the basic version, but with a dramatic improvement in UI appearance using themes like "darkly" or "journal". <br> 
Concepts Covered: Using ttkbootstrap for theming, Theming a Tkinter window with ttk.Window(themename=...), GUI styling with dark and light modes, Reusable layout logic with upgraded visuals <br>

### 4. Widget Playground (Cheatsheet)
**File:** `04_widgets_learning`  <br> 
**Description:** A fully functional and self-documented cheatsheet that demonstrates all commonly used Tkinter widgets ‚Äî including labels, text fields, entry, buttons, sliders, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and more. Also includes usage of `StringVar`, `IntVar`, `BooleanVar`, and event handling for real-world applications. <br> 
**Concepts Covered:** Widget creation, user input, event handling, variable binding, layout management, and GUI-driven logic. <br>

### 6. Simpler Version of Paint ‚Äì Drawing & Canvas Playground
**File:**: 05_gui_components_and_drawing.py <br>
**Description:** This file introduces a simplified version of Microsoft Paint using Tkinter. It includes essential GUI components like Canvas, Combobox, and Spinbox, and provides mouse-driven drawing functionality. Users can select brush colors and sizes, use an eraser (by setting color to background), clear the canvas, and draw static shapes like circles. This acts as a practical cheat sheet for creating interactive drawing tools in Python GUI applications. <br>
**Concepts Covered:** 
-Using Canvas for shape rendering <br>
-Dynamic drawing with mouse events (<Button-1> and <B1-Motion>) <br>
-Brush customization using StringVar (color) and IntVar (size)<br>
-Interactive widgets: Combobox (color selection), Spinbox (size control), Button <br>
-Binding widget values to variables <br>
-Function-based UI logic (e.g., clear canvas, draw shape, eraser)<br>
-Event handling in GUI apps<br>

Widgets Used: tk.Canvas, ttk.Combobox, tk.Spinbox, ttk.Button, StringVar and IntVar bindings <br>
